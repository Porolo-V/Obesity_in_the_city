### Introduction

- Elevated body weight is associated with an increased risk of comorbid diseases;
- The burden on health care systems is rising;
- Only 5% of obesity cases are related to genetic factors and manifest in childhood;
- Metropolises have the most expressed fatogenic environment; the more urbanized the environment, the higher the prevalence of obesity.
-  BMI has previously been used to predict morbidity risks; but the outbreak of type 2 diabetes mellitus among people with normal BMI has shown the low sensitivity of BMI at the individual level.
- Revealing the phenomenon of hidden obesity: absence of obesity symptoms with reduced muscle and mineral mass (normal BMI with high fat percentage).

### Objective, tasks and data

**Primary objective:** Metrological analysis of the agreement of estimates of absolute values of fat and fat-free body mass, as well as the proportion of body fat obtained using bioimpedance analysis and ultrasound to determine the possibility of their interchangeability. 
**Additional objective:** Design of a formula for converting values from one method to another and evaluation of accuracy on a test sample.

**The following tasks were set in order to achive the goal:**

1. **Study of theoretical foundations and principles of metrological analysis of comparability of measurements**, including analysis by Pearson and Spearman correlation methods, Lin's coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis;
2. To **check the data for significant differences** in body composition estimates between the methods, taking into account the gender and morphological features of the subjects, and, if necessary, to  make stratification into subgroups;
3. **Examine correlations** between the results obtained by different methods for absolute values of fat and fat-free mass, as well as the proportion of body fat mass;
4. Assess the agreement of consistency of the measurement methods using **Lin's concordant correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis**;
5. *If the consistency isn’t acceptable, analyse the shift in metrics estimates between methods using regression techniques such as: **linear regression, Deming regression and **Passing-Bablok** regression;** 
6. **Calculate a formula** for converting the results of one method to another and validate the accuracy on a test sample.

### Data overview
**Provided data:**

- ID;
- Age (full years);
- Sex;
- Height (cm);
- Weight;
- FM - Fat Mass (kg);
- BF - body fat proportion (%);
- FFM - Fat-free mass (kg);
- BIA - Bioimpedance analysis (Method 1);
- US - Ultrasound scanning (Method 2);

_*Body mass (Weight) = FM + FFM
*BF = FM/Body mass_

**Сalculated data:**

- BMI = Weight : (Height)²

_*Total number of observations (after removing 3 cases of misprints) - 276_

### Checking the data for significant differences:
Вody composition estimates between methods revealed the influence of sexual dimorphism on parameter estimates, so the data were **stratified by sex** into datasets data_male/data_female

### Correlation and agreement analys results
- The **Pearson** correlation coefficients for the measurements of the two methods range from 0,83 - 0,97, indicating a very strong linear relationship between the BIA and ultrasound methods.

- However, there is poor agreement by  **Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient** for most of the method comparisons.

- **Bland-Altman analyses** also revealed significant differences and systematic shifts in parameter estimates between methods.

Based on these evaluations, we concluded that the **agreement between bioimpedance and ultrasound methods is not high enough to assume their metrological compatibility**, so we proceeded to the next objective, which was to calculate a formula for converting the measurements of one method to the other.
